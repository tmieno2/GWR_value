Bullock. 2019. “I-CORPS Interviews.”
 Is not a published paper^^^

Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of 	Agriculture. Web Soil Survey. https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/.

Taken from how to cite on the website^^^^

The EDF papers were sent to me by Dr. Bullock. I copied his citations. The links take me straight to the papers but I cannot find where they came from on google.
