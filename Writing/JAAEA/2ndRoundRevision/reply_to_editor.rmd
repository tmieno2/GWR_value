Your comments are in blue, and our responses are in black.

1. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Title) Please revise the title. When I read the title I assumed that using GWR is the source of mis-specification. I don't know that GWR even needs to be in the title. For example, "Economic Evaluation of Mis-specified Functional Form for Site-specific Nitrogen Management". </span>


2. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 18-19) It seems like you need to emphasize again in the introduction that the ideal method is to use a method like GWR with the correct functional form. </span>

**Response**: That you for the suggestion. We added sentences "Ideally, the GWR model should be specified with quadratic-plateau or more flexible functional forms. However, no software package is readily usable to estimate GWR with nonlinear functional form." in the introduction (page ??, lines ??) to emphasize the ideal method is QP GWR or more flexible GWR, but is not currently available.


3. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 42) It is unclear to me what you mean by "costly spatial field and soil data." They are still using OFPE data, correct? This gets clearer later in the paper, but needs to be better explained in the intro. Why does GWR need less costly data than machine learning approaches? </span>

**Response**: Our apologies for the confusion. The "costly spatial field and soil data" are not OFPE (yield, input) data. They are the soil sampling and sensing data. We have modified our writing to make this clarification in the revised manuscript (see page ??, lines ??). We have also move the explanations of why GWR does not need those costly data to the earlier part (see page ??, lines ??). 


4. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 44) Please be more specific about what you mean by "such data." </span>

**Response**: Same as our response to comment 3, "such data" means the field characteristics data such as soil sampling and sensing data. We deleted this expression in the revised manuscript as it is clearly repetitive.


5. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 54) It seems that you put too much emphasis on this one study in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph. This is not a major article that deserves other papers written on it. I think the broader point that you are trying to make is about several articles that use GWR with quadratic response functions. I suggest you rewrite to be broader and clearer. </span>

**Response**: We followed the suggestion and have removed 7 places that cited @trevisan2021spatial in the revised manuscript, and only mentioned the @trevisan2021spatial only when it's absolutely necessary (such as using it to name the GWRT model or discussing its results). The revised manuscript is also more broadly mentioning the general terms like "quadratic GWR" instead of the exact @trevisan2021spatial citation (for example, see the change from line 161 in previous manuscript to line ?? in the revised manuscript).


6. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 58) You don't need to speculate on why they made this assumption. You can simply state that no software packages allow nonlinear function form. </span>

**Response**: Thank you for the suggestion. We have removed the expression "it seems likely that ..." to make the tone less speculative (see updated writing in page ??, lines ??).


7. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 73) functional form </span>

**Response**: We removed "the" and added "functional form" as you suggested (see page ??, line ??). Thank you for the correction.


8. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 128) This section seems like a repeat of your introduction and could be dropped after improving introduction. </span>

**Response**: We acknowledge the redundancy in this section and have consolidated it into the introduction. Additionally, we have condensed and incorporated Section 2.1 into the introduction as well. Section 2.1 of the conceptual framework was dropped as the corresponding concept is already explicitly expressed in the introduction. These edits enhance the manuscript's conciseness and align it with the specified word limit.


9. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 163) this language still sounds like GWR is the source of bias.  </span>

**Response**: That language was modified to "[...] to quantify in the context of the simulations the true economic value of GWR-based VRA and the bias in the estimation of that value" (page ??, lines ??), which hopefully eliminates the confusion that GWR is the source of the bias.


10. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 238-239) Perhaps I am misunderstanding but it seems that you need N rates above the plateau to be able to estimate the plateau. Why not find the impact of applying 120% of the critical N rate so that they simulated data traces out the full plateau function. </span>

**Response**: This is a very good suggestion. In fact, in our simulation codes we expanded the lower (0%) and upper (100%) bounds of trial N rates by 20 kg ha$^{-1}$ to ensure the range of trial N rates can fully cover all cells' plateau points as well as the response curve segments near the plateau points. We apologize that we forgot to include this specific detail in the previous manuscript. This detail is added in the revised manuscript (page ??, line ??).


11. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 245) typo. </span>

**Response**: We double checked and the period (.) is showed correctly in the Word document. This typo may happened in the PDF generating process from the Journal of AAEA submission website.


12. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 313) This sentence sounds like the bias is GWR. Please rewrite to be clear that bias of mis-specified functional form. Please read through the entire manuscript and make sure this is clear. </span>

**Response**: The entire subsection was rewritten to clarify that the bias in economic value estimation of GWR-based VRA is due to mis-specified GWR response functional form. Especially, the statement "Because $\hat{f}^{GWR}_{j,i}(\cdot)$ is mis-specified in functional form and deviating from the true response $f_{j,i}(\cdot)$, the estimated economic value of GWR-based VRA $\hat{\Delta}^{GWR}$ is likely biased from the true economic value $\Delta^{GWR}$." was added before defining the bias calculation equation (see page ??, line ??).


13. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 323) It seems to me that you should also do a comparison with the "true" site-specific model. For example, calculate the true optimal N rate and substitute this into the true function to give you the true profits of site-specific N application denoted as Pi^TRUE. Then you can calculate Pi^True - Pi^GWR and Pi^True - Pi^SCAM. These would tell you how much of the potential profits of site-specific N are missed due to functional form misspecification.  Is this what you did on line 354. It is unclear. </span>

**Response**: That is not how we measured the profit in this study. But we understand what this comment is suggesting. We agree that using the profit of true optimal N rate as the benchmark level provides a consistent anchor point to show the profit losses of GWR and SCAM models from the theoretically maximum profit. However, the $\Pi^{TRUE}$ will be cancelled out in the true economic value calculation of $\Delta^{GWR} = (\Pi^{GWR} - \Pi^{TRUE}) - (\Pi^{SCAM} - \Pi^{TRUE}) = \Pi^{GWR} - \Pi^{SCAM}$. In addition, this measure may not apply to the estimated economic value calculation. Note that under the estimated response $\hat{f}^{GWR}(\cdot)$, the estimated $\hat{N}^{*GWR}$ actually has higher profit than the true optimal $N^*$, which may create more confusions for the readers.

We believe the confusion of using true optimal N rate may come from the $N^*_{j,i}$ definition equation (page 13, line 237 of previous manuscript). The calculation of $N^*_{j,i}$ is solely for the purpose of comparing with the estimated optimal N rates to show the estimation performances. The $N^*_{j,i}$ themselves are never used in any profit calculation. We added a new statement "Note that the true $N^*_{j,i}$s are not observable by producers or researchers, and are not used in the profit calculation in this study." in the revised manuscript to clarify that (see page ??, lines ??).


14. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 369) typo </span>

**Response**: The typo was corrected.


15. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 397) Please revise this language through the manuscript. It sounds like it is a difference between GWR and SCAM. But it is really a difference between quadratic GWR and a more flexible functional form with no spatial heterogeneity. </span>

**Response**: We revised this part of writing to make it more explicit that the estimated yield response is based on the mis-specified quadratic GWR (see page ??, lines ??). The remaining part of that paragraph's writing was also modified to more clearly illustrate the sources of the GWR value over-estimation.


16. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 399) please revise this language throughout the manuscript. It is a quadratic GWR. </span>

**Response**: We used a more explicit expression of "estimated yield response by the mis-specified quadratic GWR" in the revised writing (see page ??, line ??). [We also emphasized that point in the introduction (see page ??, line ??) to clarify this concept at the beginning of this manuscript.]


16. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 415-416) I suggest deleting this. Your results can't determine if there is any effect of this type of bias. </span>

**Response**: [I tend to agree with the deletion.]


17. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 422) For the particular simulations that you conduct. </span>

**Response**: [under low to median nitrogen prices; ]


18. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 424-426) I assume these studies evaluate the accuracy of GWR, but you are not testing the accuracy of GWR. I suggest rewording or deleting. </span>

**Response**: [that is one novelty of our study, we measure economic performance]


19. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 438) Choose a different word. </span>

**Response**: We changed it to "problematic" (see page ??, line ??)


20. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 457) Remove "in reality". </span>

**Response**: Removed in revised manuscript.


21. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 459-460) Again, too much emphasis on this one article. </span>

**Response**: []


22. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 464) Please reword. </span>

**Response**: 


23. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 468-474) Delete this. You could already assess the performance of GWR if you assume the true model is quadratic and see how well GWR with the correct functional form does. But then that raises questions about how you chose the distribution of the parameter values. </span>

**Response**: We deleted the paragraph.
