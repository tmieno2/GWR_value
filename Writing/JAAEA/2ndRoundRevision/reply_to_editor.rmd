Your comments are in blue, and our responses are in black.

1. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Title) Please revise the title. When I read the title I assumed that using GWR is the source of mis-specification. I don't know that GWR even needs to be in the title. For example, "Economic Evaluation of Mis-specified Functional Form for Site-specific Nitrogen Management". </span>

**Response**: Your suggested title seems too general. We indeed asess only GWR-based VRA. We have changed the title to the following:

"Bias in the Estimation of the Value of VRA over URA: A Case of Mis-speficied Geographically Weighted Regression Models."

Please note that we do include "mis-specified" (in the current and old title). So, we believe that the title does not suggest that we are examining the bias introduced by GWR per se.

2. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 18-19) It seems like you need to emphasize again in the introduction that the ideal method is to use a method like GWR with the correct functional form. </span>

**Response**: That you for the suggestion. We added sentences "Ideally, the GWR model should be specified with quadratic-plateau or more flexible functional forms. However, no software package is readily usable to estimate GWR with nonlinear functional form." in the introduction (page ??, lines ??) to emphasize the ideal method is QP GWR or more flexible GWR, but is not currently available.


3. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 42) It is unclear to me what you mean by "costly spatial field and soil data." They are still using OFPE data, correct? This gets clearer later in the paper, but needs to be better explained in the intro. Why does GWR need less costly data than machine learning approaches? </span>

**Response**: Please note that the exact sentence is removed after modifying out introduction. However, we make this point clearer in the third pragraphr of the introduction. 

4. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 44) Please be more specific about what you mean by "such data." </span>

**Response**: We deleted the sentence while modifying the introduction.


5. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 54) It seems that you put too much emphasis on this one study in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph. This is not a major article that deserves other papers written on it. I think the broader point that you are trying to make is about several articles that use GWR with quadratic response functions. I suggest you rewrite to be broader and clearer. </span>

**Response**: Here, it is important to talk about Trevisan et al (2021) in the introduction. As written in the same paragraph, their estimates of the value of GWR-based VRA over URA are unreasonably higher compared to the previous studies (five times higher). Thjat's how we started to wonder what is causing this seemingly excessive value of VRA over URA. We hypothesize that this is caused by functional form misspecification and also potentially inaccuracy with coefficient estimation by GWR. We tested it and we showed that it is indeed the case that GWR with quadratic functional form when the true yield response is quadratic-plateau severely over-estimate the value of VRA over URA. While this paper may not be a major article, its implication to the precision agriculture is large. It is basically claiming that stop doins soil sampling because GWR can get you $50/ha more benefit using VRA rather than URA, where in reality its value is almost nascent. 

However, we followed the suggestion and have removed 6 places that cited @trevisan2021spatial in the revised manuscript, and only mentioned the @trevisan2021spatial only when it's absolutely necessary (such as using it to name the GWRT model or discussing its results). The revised manuscript is also more broadly mentioning the general terms like "quadratic GWR" instead of the exact @trevisan2021spatial citation (for example, see the change from line 161 in previous manuscript to line ?? in the revised manuscript).


6. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 58) You don't need to speculate on why they made this assumption. You can simply state that no software packages allow nonlinear function form. </span>

**Response**: Thank you for the suggestion. We now have the following sentence (see updated writing in page ??, lines ??):

"Trevisan et al (2021) had to choose the quadratic functional form because no readily usable statistical software or package could be used to implement quadratic-plateau GWR at the time."

7. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 73) functional form </span>

**Response**: We removed "the.""


8. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 128) This section seems like a repeat of your introduction and could be dropped after improving introduction. </span>

**Response**: We integrated the discussion of the source of bias in estimating the value of VRA over URA into the second paragraph of the introduction. We also moved the conceptual framework to Appendix.


9. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 163) this language still sounds like GWR is the source of bias.  </span>

**Response**: We rewrote the paragraph to include the following sentence:

"We cannot use real data to achieve this objective because we never observe the true site-specific yield response functions. But in the Monte Carlo simulations, we can specify yield response functions and generate data from those functions, which enables us to quantify the true economic value of the mis-specified GWR-based VRA over URA and the bias in the estimation of that value in the context of the simulations."

We believe we no longer attribute bias to the use of GWR alone.

10. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 238-239) Perhaps I am misunderstanding but it seems that you need N rates above the plateau to be able to estimate the plateau. Why not find the impact of applying 120% of the critical N rate so that they simulated data traces out the full plateau function. </span>

**Response**: This is a very good suggestion. In fact, we expanded the lower (0%) and upper (100%) bounds of trial N rates by 20 kg ha$^{-1}$ to ensure the range of trial N rates can fully cover all cells' plateau points. We added the following sentence (page ??, line ??):

"We then subtract 20 kg ha$^{-1}$ from the 0% quantile and add 20 kg ha$^{-1}$ from the 100% quantile to ensure that the range of trial N rates fully encompass the true plateau points"

11. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 245) typo. </span>

**Response**: We double checked and the period (.) is showed correctly in the Word document. This typo may happened in the PDF generating process from the Journal of AAEA submission website.

12. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 313) This sentence sounds like the bias is GWR. Please rewrite to be clear that bias of mis-specified functional form. Please read through the entire manuscript and make sure this is clear. </span>

**Response**: The entire subsection was rewritten to clarify that the bias in economic value estimation of GWR-based VRA is due to mis-specified GWR response functional form. Especially, the statement "Because $\hat{f}^{GWR}_{j,i}(\cdot)$ is mis-specified in functional form and deviating from the true response $f_{j,i}(\cdot)$, the estimated economic value of GWR-based VRA $\hat{\Delta}^{GWR}$ is likely biased from the true economic value $\Delta^{GWR}$." was added before defining the bias calculation equation (see page ??, line ??).


13. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 323) It seems to me that you should also do a comparison with the "true" site-specific model. For example, calculate the true optimal N rate and substitute this into the true function to give you the true profits of site-specific N application denoted as Pi^TRUE. Then you can calculate Pi^True - Pi^GWR and Pi^True - Pi^SCAM. These would tell you how much of the potential profits of site-specific N are missed due to functional form misspecification.  Is this what you did on line 354. It is unclear. </span>

**Response**: First of all, you seem to think that the bias is only coming from functional form misspecification according to several of your comments. But, the bias we observe is a combination of functional form misspecifciation and also the use of GWR. Since we (anybody in practice) assume that the "estimated" site-specific yield response functions are true because we never know the truth, the use of GWR itself will cause bias in estimating the value of VRA over URA. This can be found if we can estimate GWR with quadratic plateau applied to data generatic process where yield reponse to nitrogen follows quadratic plateau. We are adding bias coming from assuming the wrong functional form of quadratic model to this bias. We will not be able to separate them out. But, the evaluation of this bias is important because as we found out it significantly over-estimates the value of VRA over URA.

Note that our focus is more on the value of VRA over URA. $\Pi^{TRUE}$ will be cancelled out anyway when we calculate the true economic value of VRA over URA with $\Delta^{GWR} = (\Pi^{GWR} - \Pi^{TRUE}) - (\Pi^{SCAM} - \Pi^{TRUE}) = \Pi^{GWR} - \Pi^{SCAM}$. 

It might be that the confusion of using true optimal N rate may come from the $N^*_{j,i}$ definition equation (page 13, line 237 of previous manuscript). The calculation of $N^*_{j,i}$ is solely for the purpose of comparing with the estimated optimal N rates to show the estimation performances. The $N^*_{j,i}$ themselves are never used in any profit calculation. We added a new statement "Note that the true $N^*_{j,i}$s are not observable by producers or researchers, and are not used in the profit calculation in this study." in the revised manuscript to clarify that (see page ??, lines ??). We also moved the equation ......... 


1.  <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 369) typo </span>

**Response**: The typo was corrected.


15. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 397) Please revise this language through the manuscript. It sounds like it is a difference between GWR and SCAM. But it is really a difference between quadratic GWR and a more flexible functional form with no spatial heterogeneity. </span>

**Response**: We modify the sentence so that we are not generalizing our results.

16. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 399) please revise this language throughout the manuscript. It is a quadratic GWR. </span>



16. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 415-416) I suggest deleting this. Your results can't determine if there is any effect of this type of bias. </span>

**Response**: We deleted the sentence. We also modified the first several sentences so that we accurately describe what we found.


17. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 422) For the particular simulations that you conduct. </span>

**Response**: We removed the sentence entirely as it is not our focus of our study and it is rather distracting.


18. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 424-426) I assume these studies evaluate the accuracy of GWR, but you are not testing the accuracy of GWR. I suggest rewording or deleting. </span>

**Response**: We actually deleted the entire paragraph as our focus is really examining the bias in the estimation of the value of VRA over URA, which is now made clear in the Introduction.


19. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 438) Choose a different word. </span>

**Response**: We replaced "dangerous" with "problematic."


20. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 457) Remove "in reality". </span>

**Response**: Removed in revised manuscript.


21. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 459-460) Again, too much emphasis on this one article. </span>

**Response**: Removed in revised manuscript. 


22. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Line 464) Please reword. </span>

**Response**: We were not quite sure about the problem with the wording. We changed it to the following:

"In the future, it would be interesting to investigate..."


23. <span style = "color: blue;"> (Lines 468-474) Delete this. You could already assess the performance of GWR if you assume the true model is quadratic and see how well GWR with the correct functional form does. But then that raises questions about how you chose the distribution of the parameter values. </span>

**Response**: We deleted the paragraph.
